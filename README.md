# Mastering software development in R
## Introduction
In this project, you can get a R package which enables you to analyse the earthquake data set.

## General overview
In this package the data set is included and can be directly used. 

With the R package it is possible to
1) get a cleaned data set
2) plot the data along a timeline to display when the earthquakes occured, which magnitude the earthquake had
3) create a map in which the earthquakes are plotted at a defined position and to get some more information on the earthquake.
